# This docker image is a build environment for working with the gem5
# simulator. It includes all the tools necessary to build and run gem5. It
# is assumed that you keep the actual gem5 git respository and build tree
# on your host system and mount that into your docker container. To do
# this, build the gem5-dev docker image like this:
#   docker build -t gem5-dev $DOCKER_DIR
# Once you have this image, you can run it with:
#   docker run -v $GEM5_HOST_WORKDIR:/gem5 --rm -it gem5-dev [<cmd>]
